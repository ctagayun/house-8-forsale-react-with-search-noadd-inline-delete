     This component will use the stateful searchStateFulVar from the 
   search component to filter the houseArray by their "country"

   props to the HouseList component

     This component will store the value of "search text box"
   in a local storage by using side effect.

   side-effect each time the searchTerm changes

  //There is a callback function in the App component called "searchHandler". 
  //This handler is passed as prop to SearchComponent when it is instantiated
  //in App component. The useState for this component is defined in App as well.
  //It looks like this:
  // const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');
  const Search = (props) => {

    //Note: 
    //   1. onChange={props.onSearch} now has the value "searchHandler"
    //because it was passed as props and assigned to an HTML attribute 
    //called "onSearch" when Search component was instantiated in App
    //  
    //   2. Here we added a "value" attribute instead of giving the 
    //html element the freedom of keeping track of its internal state.
    //Instead React uses state by leveraging the "value" attribute.
    //Whenever the HTML element emits change event the new value 
    //is written to React states and re-renders the component. Then
    //the HTML element uses the recent state as value again.
